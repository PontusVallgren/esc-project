# ESC-Project

This is a layout and design created on request from Hacker Escape Room following a specific wireframes/figma layout/design with both a desktop and mobile version.

### Focus

Implementing a responsive layout and design follow exact specification from a designer.

Well structured semantic HTML for great accessibility.

### Build with

- HTML
- SASS / CSS

### What i learned

Better understanding how to build a responsive web design with media queries.

First time using SASS and had a great experience with laborating with nesting, variables, mixins and placeholders. That gave me a better working flow and made me avoid duplicating code over and over again.

Reading up alot and got a better understanding about accessibility and how semantic HTML will help with that. First time using a screen reader to help understand the importance of semantic HTML.
